# 🚀 Directional Well Calculator

A modern web-based tool for calculating directional drilling trajectories, specifically designed to assist drilling engineers, students, and petroleum professionals.
Built with **React**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Lucide Icons** — deployed on **Vercel**.

---

## 📌 Features

* 🛢️ **Directional Well Trajectory Calculations**
* 📐 Supports **Type-I Well Profile (Build & Hold)**
* 🔢 Computes:

  * Radius of Curvature
  * Build Angle (α)
  * Horizontal and Vertical Displacement
  * Measured Depth (MD)
* 📊 Displays Key Survey Points:

  * Surface (A)
  * Kick-off Point (B)
  * End of Build (C)
  * Target (T)
* 🎨 Responsive & modern UI using TailwindCSS
* ⚡ Fast performance with Vite bundling

## 🌍 Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**, and supports automatic builds when changes are pushed to GitHub.

---

## 📘 Usage Instructions

1. Select **Type-I Well Profile**
2. Enter required parameters:

   * V<sub>B</sub> — Vertical depth at KOP
   * V<sub>T</sub> — Final true vertical depth
   * H<sub>T</sub> — Horizontal displacement
   * BUR — Build Up Rate (°/100 ft)
3. Click **Calculate Trajectory**
4. View results and trajectory points

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

* Support **Well Types II, III, IV**
* Graphical well path plotting
* Export to **Excel / PDF**
* Unit conversion (**ft ↔ meters**, degrees ↔ radians)
* Save and load designs
